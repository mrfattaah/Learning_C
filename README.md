##ABOUT

This is a repository containing my learning progress of the C Programming Language. I actually started learning C in 2021 August with ALX-SE when I was accepted for the Software Engineering Program, but I have not been really so consistent and intentional about it.

However, I took up a #100DaysOfCode challenge with a Tech community; "BuildWithVee" on 17th January 2023, and since then I have been more consistent in comparison to my previous commitment.
